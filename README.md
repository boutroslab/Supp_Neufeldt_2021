[Neufeldt _et al._](http://LINK_TBA), 2021, **SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response through cGAS-STING and NF-κB**, _communications biology_

## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: middle;">
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has rapidly spread, causing a global pandemic. In the
majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild disease; however, in a significant
proportion of infections, individuals develop severe symptoms that can lead to long-lasting
lung damage or death. These severe cases are often associated with high levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses, which can cause systemic complications.
Here, we have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine secretion profiles and detected a distinct
upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in infected cell cultures and samples taken from
infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific activation of NF-κB and
a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-κB response
was mediated by cGAS-STING activation and could be attenuated through several STING-
targeting drugs. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 directs a cGAS-STING mediated, NF-κB-driven 
inflammatory immune response in human epithelial cells that likely contributes to
inflammatory responses seen in patients and could be therapeutically targeted to suppress severe disease symptoms
